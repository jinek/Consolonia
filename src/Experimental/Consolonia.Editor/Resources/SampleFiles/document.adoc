= An h1 header

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. _Italic_, *bold*, and `monospace`. 
Itemized lists
look like:

* this one
** that one
*** and that one
* the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are

> They can span multiple paragraphs,

Use 2 dashes for an em-dash. 
Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. ☺

NOTE: There are many more features, https://docs.asciidoctor.org/[check the docs]

== An h2 header

Here's a numbered list:

. first item
. second item
.. a item
... roman item
. third item

Here's a code sample, various syntax highlighters supported:

[source,csharp]
----
// Let me re-iterate ...
foreach (var item in items) { 
    DoSomething(item); <1>
} 
----
<1> Annotations possible, will not be copied with source -- very helpful


=== An h3 header [[a_label]]

Now a nested list:

. First, get these ingredients:
** carrots
** celery
** lentils
. Boil some water.
. Dump everything in the pot and follow
this algorithm:

----
    find wooden spoon
    uncover pot
    stir
    cover pot
    balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
    wait 10 minutes
    goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Here's a link to http://foo.bar[a website], to a link:local-doc.html[local doc], and to a <<a_label,label>> in the current doc. 

.Tables can look like this
|===
|size |material |color

|9
|leather
|brown

|10
|hemp canvas
|natural

|11
|glass
a|
* Render in cell:
** transparent
** opaque
|===

A horizontal rule follows:

'''

If graphics package is installed this will render, otherwise https://kroki.io/[Kroki] can be used as well:

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
hide empty methods

class Foo
{
    -int _bar;

    +void ToString()
}

class Baz {
    +List<Foo> Foos
}

Foo "n" -r-- "1..4" Baz: has

@enduml
----

Images can be specified inline image:example-image.jpg[image] and block like so:

.with an optional label
image::example-image.jpg[Block image]

Inline math equations go in like so: stem:[\omega = d\phi / dt]. 
Display math should get its own line:

stem:[I = \int \rho R^{2} dV]

Full stem:[\LaTeX] math support 🙃

==== Even more
