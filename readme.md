# 🚀 Modern UI Power, Now in Your Console

The wait is over. After months of passionate building, testing, and refining, **Consolonia** is stepping into the light — now available in **beta** for all who dare to reimagine what’s possible in the console world.

## 💡 Quick Start

The quickest way to get started is to install the dotnet template and create a project using the template:
```
dotnet new install Consolonia.Templates
```
Then you create a project using the template like this:
```
dotnet new consolonia.app
```

And you compile and run it like this:
```
cd MyConsoloniaApp
dotnet run
```

## 🎯 Why Consolonia Matters

Consolonia isn’t just another toolkit or framework. It’s a bold rethinking of the console environment — one that **injects the benefits of the Avalonia UI framework directly into TUI applications**.

That means:
- **Sophisticated layout systems** without manual positioning headaches  
- **Rich styling and theming** you’d expect from a desktop GUI, applied seamlessly in text mode  
- **Unified control patterns** across TUI and GUI, so your skills and code can travel  
- **Cross-platform consistency**, drawing from Avalonia’s proven rendering engine  

With Consolonia, console developers finally get modern UI principles — data binding, templating, responsive layouts — all without leaving the terminal.

## ⚖️ What Sets Consolonia Apart

Here’s how Consolonia compares to traditional TUI frameworks:

| **Feature** | **Traditional TUIs** | **Consolonia + Avalonia**                                                                                       |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Layout & Positioning** | Manual coordinates or simple grid; brittle with resizing | Avalonia’s flexible layout system with responsive panels and alignment                             |
| **Styling & Theming** | Limited color palettes, hard‑coded styles | Rich theming via Avalonia’s styling engine — full color schemes, gradients, and reusable style resources        |
| **Control Set** | Minimal: basic text input, list, menu | Unified control library modeled on Avalonia’s UI elements — buttons, sliders, tree views, tab controls, and more |
| **Data Binding** | Rarely supported; requires manual refresh logic | Full Avalonia data binding system — bind to properties, collections, and commands for instant UI updates        |
| **Cross‑Platform Behavior** | Inconsistent rendering and key handling across OSes | Avalonia’s mature cross‑platform abstraction layer for identical look and feel on Windows, macOS, and Linux     |
| **Event Handling** | Ad‑hoc input loops; blocking or OS‑specific quirks | Async‑friendly event system, same patterns as Avalonia GUI apps                                                 |
| **Templating** | Usually none; monolithic rendering logic | Avalonia’s control templates — swap visual structure without touching logic                                     |
| **Tooling & Reuse** | No shared patterns with GUI frameworks | Reuse Avalonia XAML, styles, and component patterns in both console and desktop contexts                        |
| **Developer Experience** | Steep learning curve for newcomers, few docs | Leverages Avalonia’s documentation, patterns, and ecosystem for instant productivity                            |


## 🛠 Built for Builders

Under the hood, Consolonia combines **Avalonia’s mature architecture** with a snappy, console‑optimized rendering pipeline:
- **Async-friendly event handling** that just works  
- **Declarative UI definitions** familiar to Avalonia developers  
- **Tooling parity**: leverage design patterns and workflows you already know  
- **Cross-platform reach**: Windows, macOS, Linux, same behavior everywhere  

## 🌱 Join the Beta, Grow the Future

We’re looking for developers who believe the terminal can be as elegant as any GUI — and who want to build TUIs without giving up the structure, maintainability, and aesthetic control of a modern UI framework.

If that’s you, kick the tires, and help us refine Consolonia into a powerhouse for serious console development.
